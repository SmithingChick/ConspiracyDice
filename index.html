    <h1>Play the Conspiracy!</h1>
    <p>We know what you’re thinking. You’re intrigued, fascinated, wondering just how far down this particularly rabbit hole can go. Conspiracy-curious, so to speak. But maybe you’re uncertain about jumping right in. There’s no telling whose secrets you might stumble upon-- and we all know the lengths <em>They</em> will go to to protect their secrets.</p>

    <p>You’re in luck! Because we understand your hesitation (& because we’re savvy marketers), we’ve created this little trial version of the game. Click to roll the dice and see what conspiracy elements you get. Red dice are Who- people & organizations who are known in conspiracy circles. Blue are the “What” dice, green are the “Where” dice, & the yellow dice are the “Wild” dice. They have known hoaxes, oddball pop culture references, &  just plain weird elements to add some surreal zaniness. The only part of the theory missing is the “Why” and that’s where you come in. Your mission is to take all 4 elements & turn them into a conspiracy theory of your very own.  Submit your theory for a chance to become a play-tester for the real game. The best/most ridiculous/hilarious/strangest theories will be posted on our <a href="notable.html">Notable Conspiracies</a> page. If you don’t know what something is, there’s our <a href="glossary">Glossary featuring both real information and witty commentary.</p>
